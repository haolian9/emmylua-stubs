provides emmylua stub files for some lua libraries.

## contained libraries
* [x] vifm: https://github.com/vifm/vifm/blob/master/data/vim/doc/app/vifm-lua.txt
* [ ] mpv: https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/blob/master/DOCS/man/lua.rst

## todo
* annotation generators, but it seems to be hard to parse the api document of vifm and mpv
